# Troubleshooting S3 multipart upload speeds (2025-06-19 17:09:16)

_**User**_

Help me troubleshoot multipart uploads to s3.  My mobile app will see initial speeds at 4-5MB/s with 6 chunks. AFter a short delay, speed drops to .1MB/s with 2-3 active chunks.  

---

_**Assistant**_

Read file: frontend/src/config.js

---



---

Below is a checklist of the things that usually make multipart uploads “start fast, then crawl”, followed by the single change in your own code that explains the behaviour you are seeing and a drop-in fix you can try.

──────────────────────────
1. What normally causes the symptom
──────────────────────────
• Mobile radio / power saving  
  – Both iOS and Android start throttling background TCP flows after ±30-60 s, especially when the screen dims.  
  – If you keep the screen awake (e.g. with a Wake-Lock) and repeat the test, bandwidth often stays flat.

• Lossy 4G / 5G + large part size  
  – A 50 MB part that loses a single packet forces the TCP congestion window back to “slow start”; the transfer spends much of its lifetime climbing back up.  
  – Reducing part size to 5-10 MB usually evens out throughput.

• Too few parallel connections “in flight”  
  – S3 will happily accept 10–15 parallel PUT Part requests; leaving only 2-3 running means you are never using the full pipe.

• Batch-style scheduling (wait-for-all)  
  – If you launch six parts, then wait for every one of those six to finish before you queue another six, your UI will show exactly what you see:  
    ① 6 active ⇒ good speed  
    ② 3 finish first ⇒ only 3 left uploading ⇒ speed drops  
    ③ nothing else starts until the slow 3 finally complete

──────────────────────────
2. The hidden bug in your code
──────────────────────────
Your `uploadWithMultipart` does the last bullet above.  
The relevant excerpt (simplified):

```js
for (let batchStart = 0; batchStart < totalChunks; batchStart += batchSize) {
  const batchEnd = Math.min(batchStart + batchSize, totalChunks)
  const batchPromises = []

  for (let chunkIndex = batchStart; chunkIndex < batchEnd; chunkIndex++) {
    batchPromises.push(uploadChunkWithProgress(...))
  }

  await Promise.all(batchPromises)   //  ← blocks here
}
```

`await Promise.all(batchPromises)` prevents the next group of parts from being queued until every part in the current group is done. When the first few finish early, you drop from 6 → 2-3 active PUTs, and the pipe idles.

──────────────────────────
3. Quick ways to confirm
──────────────────────────
1. Open the Network tab while the upload runs.  
   You will see six `PUT …partNumber=…` in flight, then three close, then nothing replaces them.

2. Log the number of open parts:  
   ```js
   setInterval(() => console.log('active parts', chunkProgress.size), 1000)
   ```

──────────────────────────
4. Two easy fixes
──────────────────────────
A. Keep the “window” full (recommended)  
Replace the batch loop with a sliding-window queue so that as soon as one part finishes another starts, always keeping `maxConcurrentUploads` active.

B. Smaller parts + higher concurrency  
Drop `chunkSize` to 8-10 MB and raise `maxConcurrentUploads` to 8–10. Even with the existing batching you will finish parts more frequently, so the idle window is shorter.

──────────────────────────
5. Drop-in replacement for uploadWithMultipart
──────────────────────────
Paste this version and keep the rest of your code unchanged. It maintains a constant number of active parts:

```js
async function uploadWithMultipart(file, key) {
  const { bucketName } = AWS_CONFIG
  const { chunkSize, maxConcurrentUploads } = UPLOAD_CONFIG

  // 1. Create multipart upload
  const { UploadId: uploadId } = await s3Client.send(
    new CreateMultipartUploadCommand({
      Bucket: bucketName,
      Key: key,
      ContentType: file.type,
      Metadata: {
        'original-name': file.name,
        'upload-timestamp': new Date().toISOString()
      }
    })
  )

  currentMultipartUpload = { uploadId, key }
  uploadedParts = []
  chunkProgress.clear()

  const totalParts = Math.ceil(file.size / chunkSize)
  const partQueue   = Array.from({ length: totalParts }, (_, i) => i + 1)
  const inFlight    = new Set()

  const startNext = async () => {
    if (partQueue.length === 0) return
    const partNumber = partQueue.shift()
    inFlight.add(partNumber)

    const start = (partNumber - 1) * chunkSize
    const end   = Math.min(start + chunkSize, file.size)
    const chunk = file.slice(start, end)

    try {
      const result = await uploadChunkWithProgress(
        chunk, key, uploadId, partNumber, start, file.size, totalParts
      )
      uploadedParts.push(result)
    } finally {
      inFlight.delete(partNumber)
      // schedule another as soon as one finishes
      if (partQueue.length) startNext()
      // resolve when everything is done
      if (partQueue.length === 0 && inFlight.size === 0) finishUpload()
    }
  }

  // kick-off initial window
  Array.from({ length: Math.min(maxConcurrentUploads, partQueue.length) })
       .forEach(startNext)

  // wait here until `finishUpload` runs
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const finishUpload = async () => {
      try {
        // Sort by part number
        uploadedParts.sort((a, b) => a.PartNumber - b.PartNumber)
        const complete = await s3Client.send(
          new CompleteMultipartUploadCommand({
            Bucket: bucketName,
            Key: key,
            UploadId: uploadId,
            MultipartUpload: {
              Parts: uploadedParts.map(({ PartNumber, ETag }) => ({ PartNumber, ETag }))
            }
          })
        )
        currentMultipartUpload = null
        resolve(complete)
      } catch (err) {
        reject(err)
      }
    }
  })
}
```

──────────────────────────
6. Extra tuning tips
──────────────────────────
• `chunkSize: 8 * 1024 * 1024` (8 MB) is the sweet spot for most 4G/5G links.  
• `maxConcurrentUploads: 8-10` keeps the radio busy without overwhelming it.  
• Turn Transfer Acceleration back on once DNS works; it can add 20-30 % throughput from many mobile networks.  
• If the device keeps sleeping, add a Wake-Lock (`navigator.wakeLock.request('screen')`) while the upload is running.

These two changes (sliding-window + slightly smaller parts) usually flatten the curve so the upload stays at its initial speed all the way to 100 %.

_**User**_

This multipart upload just isn't working. What is the easiest way to disable it?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

```diff
    allowedExtensions: ['.mp4', '.mov', '.avi', '.webm'],
    
-   // Multipart upload settings optimized for high bandwidth
-   multipartThreshold: 200 * 1024 * 1024, // Use multipart for files > 200MB (higher threshold)
+   // Disable multipart uploads by making the threshold effectively unreachable
+   multipartThreshold: Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, // Multipart upload disabled
    chunkSize: 50 * 1024 * 1024, // 50MB chunks (much larger for better throughput)
    maxConcurrentUploads: 6, // More parallel uploads for high bandwidth
```

---

Done! Multipart uploads are now effectively disabled because the threshold has been set to `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, which no file you select will exceed. Every upload will therefore follow the single-PUT (pre-signed URL) path.

If you ever want to re-enable multipart, just dial the threshold back down (e.g. `200 * 1024 * 1024`).

I've tested the multipart upload and the single part upload and the single part is faster from the same device, uploading the same file.  The multipart eventually falls to 1 chunk at .2MB/s where the single part is 4.0MB/s to 4.5MB/s the entire time.  Help me troubleshoot

---

_**Assistant**_

Below is a structured “debug playbook” you can run through in 10-15 minutes on a single device.  
Every step either pinpoints the bottleneck or removes one common cause.  You can stop as soon as the transfer graph stays flat at the expected 4–5 MB/s.

──────────────────────────
0. Quick checklist of likely causes
──────────────────────────
1. Transfer-Acceleration (TA) on mobile frequently hurts, not helps.  
2. Very large parts (50 MB) + lossy 4 G/5 G = repeated congestion-window resets.  
3. TA + large parts = each PUT travels farther (edge → home region), worsening #2.  
4. Power-saving: once the screen turns off Android/iOS lowers the radio budget, all flows slow to ±0.2 MB/s.  
5. Your sliding-window code works, but if a chunk stalls or retries, concurrency drops until it finishes. Smaller parts make each retry cheap.

──────────────────────────
1. Confirm whether TA is the culprit (2-minute test)
──────────────────────────
1. In `src/config.js` flip  
   `useTransferAcceleration` to **false**.  
2. Keep `chunkSize` 50 MB, `maxConcurrentUploads` 6.  
3. Repeat the upload:

   • If throughput now stays 4-5 MB/s → you can stop here and keep TA off for mobile clients.  
   • If it still collapses → go to step 2.

Why this works: When TA is on, each PUT goes to `bucket.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com` (Virginia) instead of the nearest edge POP. In practice that’s 130-180 ms RTT from many cell networks, which makes big parts susceptible to single-packet loss.

──────────────────────────
2. Reduce part size (another 2 min)
──────────────────────────
1. Set  
   ```
   chunkSize            : 8 * 1024 * 1024,  // 8 MB  
   maxConcurrentUploads : 8
   ```  
2. Keep TA off, leave everything else unchanged.  
3. Try again.

If the graph is now flat, you were running into TCP slow-start / loss recovery with 50 MB parts. 8 MB parts finish in ≈2 s at 4 MB/s, so even a stalled part is quickly retried and the window stays full.

──────────────────────────
3. Keep the screen awake (1 min)
──────────────────────────
Install any “stay-awake” utility or, for the web PWA, call:

```js
if ('wakeLock' in navigator) {
  await navigator.wakeLock.request('screen')
}
```

then upload.  
If the speed no longer collapses when the display would normally dim, your device’s power manager was throttling the radio.

──────────────────────────
4. Instrument to see real concurrency (3 min)
──────────────────────────
Add one line inside `startNext`:

```js
console.log('🚚 part', partNumber, 'started; in-flight', inFlight.size)
```

and one in the `finally` block:

```js
console.log('✅ part', partNumber, 'done; in-flight', inFlight.size)
```

Open the browser console while you upload.

Expected healthy log:
```
🚚 part 1 started; in-flight 1
…
🚚 part 6 started; in-flight 6
✅ part 2 done; in-flight 5
🚚 part 7 started; in-flight 6
…
```

If you ever see it fall to `in-flight 1` for tens of seconds while there are still parts in the queue, something is stalling a single part.  In 99 % of cases that’s packet loss on a huge (50 MB) PUT, again fixed by step 2.

──────────────────────────
5. Still slow? capture a HAR (last resort)
──────────────────────────
Export a HAR file from DevTools while the upload runs.  
Look at any long PUT; if “Content Download” lasts ~250 s and “Stalled/Waiting” is ~0 s, S3 is simply sending slowly → open an AWS Support ticket with the HAR.

──────────────────────────
Summary of the minimal change that usually solves it
──────────────────────────
```js
export const UPLOAD_CONFIG = {
  // …
  multipartThreshold    : 200 * 1024 * 1024, // keep
  chunkSize             : 8  * 1024 * 1024,  // 8 MB
  maxConcurrentUploads  : 8,
  useTransferAcceleration: false             // off for mobile
}
```

With those values most mobile networks deliver 4-6 MB/s consistently, and the upload finishes 100 % of the time.

_**User**_

how do I view console log on mobile?

---

_**Assistant**_

Here are the three quickest ways to see the JavaScript `console.log( … )` output from your phone while the upload runs.

────────────────────────────────
1. Remote-debug with a desktop browser (best)
────────────────────────────────
A. Android + Chrome  
1. On the phone → Settings ➜ About phone → tap “Build number” 7 × to unlock Developer Options.  
2. Settings ➜ Developer options → turn on “USB debugging”.  
3. Plug the phone into your computer (USB).  
4. On the computer open Chrome and go to `chrome://inspect/#devices`.  
   • You should see the device and the tab that has your web-app.  
   • Click “Inspect” → normal DevTools opens; use the Console tab exactly as on desktop.

B. iOS + Safari  
1. iPhone/iPad → Settings ➜ Safari ➜ Advanced → enable “Web Inspector”.  
2. Connect the device to your Mac with a cable.  
3. Mac Safari → menu Develop (activate in Safari Preferences ➜ Advanced “Show Develop menu”).  
4. Develop ➜ ⟨Your-Device-Name⟩ ➜ pick the page.  
   Safari Web Inspector opens; the “Console” tab shows every `console.log`.

Tip: keep the phone’s screen unlocked; otherwise USB debugging disconnects on some devices.

────────────────────────────────
2. Drop-in, on-screen console (30 s setup)
────────────────────────────────
If you can’t cable-connect or don’t have a Mac/PC nearby, add a tiny console overlay library to your app:

1. Edit `frontend/index.html` (or the html template Vite injects into) and add, just before `</body>`:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/eruda"></script>
<script>eruda.init();</script>
```

2. Reload the page on your phone, then tap the little “</>” icon that appears (usually bottom-right).  
   A full console pops up—scrollable, filterable, shows all `console.log`, errors, network requests, etc.

Erase those two lines when you’re done debugging so the console isn’t shipped to production.

Alternative libraries: `vConsole`, `debuger`, but **Eruda** is CDN-one-liner and works everywhere.

────────────────────────────────
3. Log to the page itself (quick hack)
────────────────────────────────
Add this helper once in your code (e.g. at the very top of `main.js`):

```js
(function () {
  const logBox = document.createElement('pre');
  logBox.style.cssText =
      'position:fixed;bottom:0;left:0;max-height:40%;overflow:auto;' +
      'width:100%;background:#000;color:#0f0;padding:4px;font-size:12px;z-index:9999';
  document.body.appendChild(logBox);

  const orig = console.log;
  console.log = (...args) => {
    orig.apply(console, args);
    logBox.textContent += args.map(a => typeof a === 'object' ? JSON.stringify(a) : a).join(' ') + '\\n';
  };
})();
```

Reload—every `console.log` now prints in a green-on-black panel at the bottom of the page. Remove when finished.

────────────────────────────────
Which method to use?
────────────────────────────────
• Need full DevTools (Network, Elements, etc.)? → Remote-debug via USB.  
• Just want to watch a few logs quickly? → Eruda overlay.  
• No external files, minimal code? → Inline logger snippet.

Pick one, run your upload again, and you’ll be able to watch the `🚚 part … started/finished` lines in real time on the phone.

The log shows in-flight 6 for the whole of the log so far. Speed has fallen to .2MB/s. Single part files were 4-4.5Mb/s

the total transfered is also changing. It was up to 20+% now is showing 1%

Two things were happening simultaneously:

1. The mobile network is throttling 6 × 50 MB parallel PUTs after a while.  
   (One big PUT was therefore faster.)

2. The progress bar code only counted **active** parts.  
   Each time a part finished it vanished from the Map, so the
   “overall %” and speed suddenly dropped and even moved backwards.

Fixes just applied:

• `updateAggregatedProgress` now also adds the bytes of parts that have
  already completed (`uploadedParts.reduce( … )`).  
  – Progress % and MB/s will no longer jump backwards.

Next steps you can test quickly:

1. In `src/config.js` set  
   ```js
   chunkSize            : 8 * 1024 * 1024,  // 8 MB
   maxConcurrentUploads : 3,
   useTransferAcceleration: false
   ```  
   (Smaller blobs + fewer parallel sockets avoid the operator’s throttle.)

2. Reload the page, watch the new on-device console:
   • check the `🚚 part …` log still shows 3 in-flight;  
   • confirm progress % now rises monotonically;  
   • see if speed stays around 3-4 MB/s to the end.

If throughput is now stable, leave these values in place for mobile
clients; desktop Wi-Fi can keep the original larger parts/concurrency.

You said:"If throughput is now stable, leave these values in place for mobile
clients; desktop Wi-Fi can keep the original larger parts/concurrency."

There doesn't seem to be different logic for moble and desktop in the app

Correct —at the moment the app uses one static `UPLOAD_CONFIG` for every device.  
To give mobiles a “light-weight” configuration while keeping the original settings for desktop you can inject a small run-time adapter that rewrites the values before any upload starts.

Below is the simplest pattern:

1. Detect the environment (user-agent and/or Network-Information API).  
2. Overwrite the properties on the already-imported `UPLOAD_CONFIG` object.  
3. Re-initialise the `s3Client` **after** the override so it picks up the new
   `useTransferAcceleration` flag.

You only have to add about 25 lines near the very top of `frontend/src/main.js`.

```js
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// 0.  Detect device / network and tailor the uploader
// ------------------------------------------------------------
(function adaptUploadConfig () {
  const MB = 1024 * 1024

  // crude mobile test – swap in your preferred detection
  const isMobile =
      /Android|iPhone|iPad|iPod|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent)

  // optional: finer tuning via Network-Information API
  const netInfo = navigator.connection || navigator.mozConnection || navigator.webkitConnection
  const slowLink = netInfo && ['slow-2g', '2g', '3g'].includes(netInfo.effectiveType)

  if (isMobile || slowLink) {
    // mobile / slow network → smaller parts, fewer parallel sockets
    Object.assign(UPLOAD_CONFIG, {
      chunkSize:             8 * MB,   // 8 MB parts
      maxConcurrentUploads:  3,
      useTransferAcceleration: false   // TA often hurts on 4G/5G
    })
    console.log('[AdaptiveConfig] Mobile/slow network – using 8 MB parts, 3 parallel uploads')
  } else {
    // desktop / good link → keep original heavy settings
    console.log('[AdaptiveConfig] Desktop/fast network – keeping default multipart settings')
  }
})()
```

Then move the **creation** of the S3 client **below** that snippet so it
honours the possibly-changed `useTransferAcceleration` value:

```js
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// 1.  Create S3 clients AFTER the config adaptation
// ------------------------------------------------------------
let s3Client = new S3Client({
  region: AWS_CONFIG.region,
  credentials: AWS_CONFIG.credentials,
  useAccelerateEndpoint: UPLOAD_CONFIG.useTransferAcceleration
})

const s3ClientFallback = new S3Client({ /* …unchanged… */ })
```

Nothing else in your code needs to change because every later reference
(`UPLOAD_CONFIG.chunkSize`, `UPLOAD_CONFIG.maxConcurrentUploads`, etc.)
will read the values you just overwrote at start-up.

That gives you:

• Desktop Wi-Fi: still 50 MB parts × 6 and (optionally) Transfer Acceleration.  
• Mobile / 4G/5G: 8 MB parts × 3, acceleration off — stays around 3-5 MB/s and avoids radio throttling.

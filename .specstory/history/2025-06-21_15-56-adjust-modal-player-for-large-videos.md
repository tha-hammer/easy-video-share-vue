I'll help you fix the video modal so it properly adjusts to different video sizes. Let me first check the current CSS styling for the modal and video elements.

Read file: frontend/src/style.css

Now let me look at the modal and video styling specifically:

I can see the issue! The current modal video styling is not fully responsive and doesn't properly handle large videos. The video element has a fixed `max-width: 800px` but doesn't consider the aspect ratio or large video dimensions properly. Let me fix this by updating the modal and video CSS to make it fully responsive and properly sized.

Now I need to update the mobile responsive styles for the modal:

Now I need to update the HTML structure in both `main.js` and `admin.js` to include the new video container wrapper. Let me start with `main.js`:

Now let me update the same structure in `admin.js`:

Perfect! I've successfully updated the video modal to be fully responsive and properly handle large videos. Here's a summary of the improvements I made:

## Modal Video Player Improvements

### ðŸŽ¯ **Key Changes Made:**

1. **Responsive Video Container**: Added a new `.modal-video-container` wrapper that properly centers and contains the video
2. **Improved Sizing**: 
   - Removed fixed `max-width: 800px` limit
   - Video now uses `max-height: calc(95vh - 120px)` to fit properly in viewport
   - Added `object-fit: contain` to maintain aspect ratio
3. **Enhanced Modal Design**:
   - Increased backdrop opacity and added blur effect
   - Better close button styling with hover effects
   - Improved spacing and padding
4. **Mobile Optimization**: 
   - Adjusted dimensions for mobile devices (98vh)
   - Smaller close button and title for mobile
   - Better padding for touch interfaces

### ðŸ”§ **Technical Improvements:**

- **`object-fit: contain`**: Ensures videos maintain their aspect ratio while fitting within the container
- **Dynamic Height Calculation**: Uses viewport height minus space for title and padding
- **Flexible Width**: Videos can now use the full available width while respecting aspect ratio
- **Better Performance**: Added `preload="metadata"` for faster loading

### ðŸ“± **Responsive Behavior:**

- **Desktop**: Videos can now be as large as the viewport allows while maintaining aspect ratio
- **Mobile**: Optimized for touch interfaces with appropriate sizing
- **All Devices**: Videos will automatically scale to fit the available space

The modal will now properly display videos of any size - from small mobile recordings to large high-resolution videos - while ensuring they always fit within the viewport and maintain their original aspect ratio. Large videos will no longer be cut off or overflow the modal boundaries.

# Add video feature for admin (2025-06-21 17:56:24)

_**User**_

next feature to add to the admin is an 'add video' for the admin. This way an admin can add a video to a user's account.

If admin, then display 'upload video' button in user account
On click, display modal with 'upload video card' re-use card from main app.
Add video to user account only

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll help you add the "add video" feature for admins. Let me first examine the current upload functionality in the main app to understand how to reuse it.

---

Read file: frontend/src/main.js

---

Now let me see the upload form HTML and functionality:

---

Read file: frontend/src/main.js

---

Now let me examine the saveVideoMetadataToAPI function to understand how videos are saved and how I can modify it to upload to a specific user's account:

---

Read file: frontend/src/main.js

---

Now let me check the admin API to see if there's an endpoint for admin uploads:

---

Read file: frontend/src/config.js

---

Perfect! Now I have all the information I need. I'll modify the admin interface to add the "upload video" feature. Let me update the admin.js file:

---



---



---

Now I need to add the upload modal HTML to the admin interface and implement the upload functionality. Let me add the modal HTML first:

---



---

Now I need to add the upload functionality methods to the AdminUI class. Let me add these methods:

---

    at HTMLButtonElement.onclick ((index):1:9)

_**Assistant**_



---

I see the issue. The `showUploadModal` method I added might have a syntax error or there's an issue with the class definition. Let me check the admin.js file and fix the issue:

---

Read file: frontend/src/admin.js

---

Let me check the very end of the file to see the complete structure:

---

Read file: frontend/src/admin.js

---

I see the issue! The `showUploadModal` method is defined, but there might be a JavaScript syntax or import error preventing the class from loading properly. Let me check if there are any JavaScript console errors by testing the page. Also, I notice that the `bootstrap` object might not be available in the admin context.

Let me check the console and fix the bootstrap import issue:

---



---



---



---



---

Now let me check if there's an issue with the `validateAdminFile` method - it looks like it might be incomplete in the file. Let me read that section:

---

Read file: frontend/src/admin.js

---

The code looks complete. Let me run a JavaScript syntax check to make sure there are no issues. The problem might be that the admin.js module is not being properly initialized. Let me create a test to verify the admin functions are available:

---

```bash
cd /e/Dev/easy-video-share/frontend && npm run dev
```

 Upload failed: PutObjectCommand is not defined

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I see the issue! The `PutObjectCommand` is being imported in the `handleAdminUpload` method but it's not available in the `uploadFileToS3` method. Let me fix this by passing the command class as a parameter:

---



---



---

Perfect! Now the `PutObjectCommand` is properly passed as a parameter to the `uploadFileToS3` method. The admin upload functionality should now work correctly. 

The changes I made:

1. **Fixed Bootstrap import**: Added `import { Modal } from 'bootstrap'` and updated all modal references to use the imported `Modal` class instead of `bootstrap.Modal`

2. **Fixed PutObjectCommand scope issue**: The `PutObjectCommand` was being imported in the `handleAdminUpload` method but used in the `uploadFileToS3` method where it wasn't available. I fixed this by passing it as a parameter.

3. **Added upload modal and functionality**: 
   - Added "Add Video" button in the user videos view
   - Created a comprehensive upload modal with progress tracking
   - Implemented file validation, S3 upload, and metadata saving
   - Added proper error handling and user feedback

The admin can now:
- Click "Add Video" button when viewing a user's videos
- Select a video file and enter a title
- Upload the video with progress tracking
- The video will be added to the selected user's account
- The interface will refresh to show the new video

Try clicking the "Add Video" button now - it should work properly!

This error is related to how the AWS SDK handles file streams in the browser. The issue is that the AWS SDK expects a specific type of stream, but we're passing a File object directly. Let me check how the main app handles uploads and use the same approach:

---

Read file: frontend/src/main.js

---

I see! The main app uses presigned URLs with XMLHttpRequest instead of sending the file directly to S3 via the SDK. This is much more browser-compatible. Let me update the admin upload to use the same approach:

---



---



---

Perfect! I've updated the admin upload functionality to use the same approach as the main app:

**Key changes made:**

1. **Switched to presigned URLs**: Instead of sending the file directly through the AWS SDK (which was causing the stream error), now we:
   - Create a presigned URL using `getSignedUrl`
   - Upload the file using `XMLHttpRequest` with the presigned URL

2. **Added real progress tracking**: Now shows actual upload progress with:
   - Percentage complete
   - Data transferred (MB/MB)
   - Upload speed (MB/s)
   - Time remaining (ETA)

3. **Better error handling**: Uses the same robust error handling as the main app

4. **Browser compatibility**: `XMLHttpRequest` is much more reliable in browsers than the AWS SDK's direct upload approach

This should resolve the `readableStream.getReader is not a function` error and provide a much better upload experience with real-time progress tracking. The admin can now successfully upload videos to any user's account through the admin interface!

Try the upload again - it should work smoothly now with proper progress tracking.

The upload component on the admin has more errors. This was fixed in the main app why are you not re-using the component?

You're absolutely right! I should reuse the working upload component from the main app instead of recreating it. Looking at the errors, there are two main issues:

1. **CORS Issue**: The admin/videos endpoint doesn't have a POST method configured in Terraform
2. **Not reusing working code**: I recreated the upload functionality instead of reusing the proven main app code

Let me fix this by reusing the main app's upload functionality. First, let me check what the Terraform configuration is missing:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "admin_videos.*POST" â€¢ **0** files</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

I need to add the POST method for admin/videos endpoint. But first, let me reuse the main app's upload functionality instead:

---



---

Now I need to remove the old upload methods that are no longer needed:

---



---

Now I need to update the lambda backend to handle admin uploads. Let me check if the backend supports the `adminUploadUserId` field:

---

Read file: terraform/lambda/index.js

---

I need to modify the lambda function to support admin uploads where an admin can upload videos for other users. Let me update it:

---



---

Now let me add admin authorization check:

---



---

Now I need to redeploy the lambda function. Let me update the terraform deployment:

---

```bash
cd terraform && terraform apply -auto-approve
```

---

_**User**_

terraform apply successful

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Perfect! With the terraform apply successful, the admin upload feature should now work properly. Here's a summary of what I fixed:

## Key Improvements Made:

### 1. **Reused Main App Upload Logic**
- Instead of recreating upload functionality, I now reuse the proven main app logic
- Uses the same presigned URL approach with XMLHttpRequest
- Same reliable progress tracking and error handling

### 2. **Fixed CORS Issues** 
- Now uses the regular `/videos` endpoint instead of `/admin/videos`
- The `/videos` endpoint is properly configured in Terraform with CORS
- Avoids the 403 Forbidden errors you were seeing

### 3. **Added Admin Upload Support**
- Updated lambda function to support `adminUploadUserId` parameter
- Admins can now upload videos that will be assigned to other users
- Added proper authorization check - only admin group members can upload for others

### 4. **Enhanced Security**
- Backend verifies admin privileges before allowing cross-user uploads
- Videos uploaded by admin are labeled as "Admin upload by [admin email]"
- Maintains proper user ownership and permissions

## How It Works Now:

1. **Admin clicks "Add Video"** â†’ Modal opens with upload form
2. **Selects file and enters title** â†’ Uses main app's proven validation
3. **Upload process** â†’ Same reliable S3 presigned URL upload as main app
4. **Metadata saving** â†’ Uses regular `/videos` API with `adminUploadUserId` parameter
5. **Backend processing** â†’ Lambda checks admin privileges and assigns video to target user
6. **Success** â†’ Video appears in the selected user's account

The admin upload feature should now work seamlessly with the same reliability as the main app's upload functionality. Try uploading a video for a user now - it should work without any CORS or upload errors!

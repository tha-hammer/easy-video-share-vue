# Debugging segments API errors (2025-07-05 13:41Z)

_**User**_

Now that we have made changes to the UI and the backend for the segments, we need to correct errors.  

the local deployment is showing these console errors:

I can see the issue - the frontend is trying to call `/api/segments` endpoint, but we haven't implemented this endpoint in the backend yet. The 422 (Unprocessable Entity) error suggests the endpoint exists but there's a validation issue with the request parameters.

Let me first check what endpoints currently exist in the backend and then implement the missing segments endpoint.


---

Read file: backend/main.py

---

I can see that the `/api/segments` endpoint exists at line 872, but let me check the exact implementation to see what parameters it expects:


---

Read file: backend/main.py

---

Now I can see the issue! The `/api/segments` endpoint requires a `user_id` parameter, but the frontend is not providing it. Let me check how the frontend is calling this endpoint:


---

Read file: src/core/services/VideoService.ts

---

Now let me check how the segments store is calling this method:


---

Read file: src/stores/segments.ts

---

I can see the issue now. The `loadAllSegments` method is not passing a `user_id` parameter, but the backend endpoint requires it. Let me check how the auth store works to get the current user ID:


---

Read file: src/stores/auth.ts

---

Perfect! Now I can see that the auth store has a `user` object with a `userId` field. I need to update the segments store to include the user ID when calling the API. Let me fix this:


---



---



---

Let me read the exact content around that area:


---

Read file: src/stores/segments.ts

---

Now I can see the exact structure. Let me update the `loadAllSegments` method to include the user ID:


---



---

Now I need to check if the backend DynamoDB service has the `list_segments_by_user` method that the endpoint is trying to call:

</details>

Good! The method exists. Let me check its implementation:


---

Read file: backend/dynamodb_service.py

---

I can see the issue! The `list_segments_by_user` method is trying to use a GSI called `user_id-segment_type-index`, but this index doesn't exist in our current DynamoDB table. Let me check what indexes are actually defined in the Terraform configuration:


---

Read file: terraform/main.tf

---

Great! I can see that the `user_id-segment_type-index` GSI is defined in the Terraform configuration (line 190-194). However, the issue might be that the table hasn't been updated with this new index yet. Let me check if there are any segments in the database and if the backend is properly handling the case where no segments exist.

Let me also check if there are any issues with the backend models:


---

Read file: backend/models.py

---

The models look good. Now let me check if there's an issue with the backend endpoint parameters. The issue might be that the frontend is sending parameters that don't match what the backend expects. Let me check the exact error by looking at the backend logs or testing the endpoint directly.

Let me first check if the backend is running and test the endpoint:


---

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/segments?user_id=test&sort_by=date&order=desc&limit=20&offset=0" -H "Content-Type: application/json"

Let me try a different approach to test the endpoint:


---

Cancelled

_**User**_

cli output

_**Assistant**_

Great! The CLI output shows that the backend endpoint is working correctly. The API call returned a 200 status with an empty segments array:

```json
{"segments":[],"total_count":0,"page":1,"page_size":0}
```

This means:
1. ‚úÖ The backend endpoint `/api/segments` is working
2. ‚úÖ The user_id parameter is being accepted
3. ‚úÖ The response format is correct
4. ‚ùå There are no segments in the database yet

The 422 error you were seeing in the frontend was likely because the frontend wasn't sending the `user_id` parameter. Now that we've fixed the segments store to include the user ID, the frontend should work correctly.

Let me check if there are any remaining issues by looking at the frontend error more closely. The issue might be that the frontend is still using the old parameters. Let me check the VideoService interface:


---

Read file: src/core/services/VideoService.ts

---

I can see the issue! The `SegmentListParams` interface doesn't include `user_id`, but the backend expects it. I need to update the interface to include the user_id parameter:


---



---

Now let me also check if there's a mismatch in the response format. The backend returns `page` and `page_size`, but the frontend expects `has_more`. Let me check the backend response format:


---

Read file: backend/main.py

---

I can see the issue! The backend returns `page` and `page_size`, but the fronte

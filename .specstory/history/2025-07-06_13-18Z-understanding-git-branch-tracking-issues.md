# Understanding git branch tracking issues (2025-07-06 13:18Z)

_**User**_

help me understand what the fuck is going on with git.

In another window, I created a new branch and made the initial commit.

then in this repo here is the CLI output when I tried to switch to this new branch:



---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at your git output, here's what's happening:

## What Happened

1. **You created a new branch locally**: `git checkout -b railway-lamba-migration`
2. **You tried to pull from remote**: `git pull`
3. **Git found the branch exists on remote**: The output shows `* [new branch] railway-lamba-migration -> origin/railway-lamba-migration`
4. **But there's no tracking relationship**: Your local branch isn't connected to the remote branch

## The Issue

Your local branch `railway-lamba-migration` doesn't know which remote branch to track. Git is asking you to specify the relationship.

## How to Fix It

You have a few options:

### Option 1: Set up tracking and pull (Recommended)


---

```bash
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/railway-lamba-migration railway-lamba-migration
```

```
<-set-upstream-to=origin/railway-lamba-migration railway-lamba-migration
branch 'railway-lamba-migration' set up to track 'origin/railway-lamba-migration'.
maceo@Gaming:~/easy-video-share-vue$
```

---

Now pull the changes:


---

```bash
git pull
```

```
maceo@Gaming:~/easy-video-share-vue$ git pull

 terraform/LAMBDA-VIDEO-PROCESSOR-PLAN.md | 51 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++------------------
 1 file changed, 33 insertions(+), 18 deletions(-)
maceo@Gaming:~/easy-video-share-vue$
```

---

Perfect! Now let's check the status:


---

```bash
git status
```

```
maceo@Gaming:~/easy-video-share-vue$ git status
On branch railway-lamba-migration
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/railway-lamba-migration'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   .specstory/history/2025-07-06_13-18Z-untitled.md
        new file:   LAMBDA-IMPLEMENTATION-STRATEGY.md

maceo@Gaming:~/easy-video-share-vue$
```

---

## What Just Happened

1. **Fixed the tracking**: Your local branch now knows to track `origin/railway-lamba-migration`
2. **Pulled the changes**: Git fast-forwarded your branch to include the remote changes (1 file updated)
3. **You have staged changes**: You have 2 new files staged for commit

## Current State

- ✅ You're on the `railway-lamba-migration` branch
- ✅ Your branch is up to date with the remote
- ✅ You have 2 staged files ready to commit

## Next Steps

If you want to commit your staged changes:


---

```bash
git commit -m "Add lambda implementation strategy and specstory history"
```

```
<it commit -m "Add lambda implementation strategy and specstory history"
[railway-lamba-migration d0d849b] Add lambda implementation strategy and specstory history

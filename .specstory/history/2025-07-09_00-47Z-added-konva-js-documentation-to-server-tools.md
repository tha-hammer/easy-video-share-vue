I added Konva.js documentation to your mcp server tools

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is telling me that they've added Konva.js documentation to my MCP server tools. Konva.js is a powerful 2D canvas library for desktop and mobile applications. 

Looking at the project structure, I can see this is a Vue.js video sharing application with segments functionality. The user has a segments library where they can view and manage video segments.

The user is likely telling me this because they want to use Konva.js for some video-related functionality - perhaps for video editing, annotations, thumbnails, or some kind of canvas-based video manipulation.

However, I don't see any specific request or question in their message. They're just informing me that they've added the documentation. I should acknowledge this and perhaps ask what they'd like to do with Konva.js in the context of their video sharing application.

Let me respond appropriately to acknowledge this and see what they want to do with it.</details></think>

Great! I can see that you've added Konva.js documentation to the MCP server tools. Konva.js is a powerful 2D canvas library that's excellent for creating interactive graphics and animations.

Looking at your video sharing application, I can see you have a segments library with video segments functionality. Konva.js could be really useful for several video-related features like:

- **Video thumbnails and previews** - Creating interactive thumbnail generators
- **Video annotation tools** - Adding text, shapes, or drawings over video frames
- **Video editing interfaces** - Building timeline scrubbers, crop tools, or filters
- **Interactive video players** - Custom controls and overlays
- **Social media content creation** - Adding graphics, text, or effects to video segments

What would you like to implement with Konva.js in your video application? Are you looking to:
1. Add video editing capabilities?
2. Create interactive thumbnails or previews?
3. Build annotation tools for video segments?
4. Something else entirely?

Let me know what specific functionality you'd like to build, and I can help you integrate Konva.js into your Vue.js application!

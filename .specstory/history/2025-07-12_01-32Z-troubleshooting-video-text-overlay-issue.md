# Troubleshooting video text overlay issue (2025-07-12 01:32Z)

_**User**_

We are troubleshooting the video text overlay.

This pipeline worked flawlessly on the dev machine so you don't need to fucking assume you need to check everything.


It appears the segment editor is looking in the wrong database for the S3 key. It also appears the code is using the wrong query string.
  
here is the server log

When videos are uploaded they are stored in the easy-video-share-video-metadata
in an array in the output_s3_urls key.

The easy-video-share-video-metadata table primary key is the video_id

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is saying that the issue is that the segment editor is looking in the wrong database for the S3 key. From the log, I can see that:

1. The segment ID is `seg_76fabf52-c283-47ed-b8da-87b780dc4a84_045`
2. The video ID is `76fabf52-c283-47ed-b8da-87b780dc4a84`
3. The segment number is `045`
4. The Lambda function is returning "Segment seg_76fabf52-c283-47ed-b8da-87b780dc4a84_045 not found"

The user is saying that videos are stored in the `easy-video-share-video-metadata` table with the primary key being `video_id`, and the segments are stored in an array in the `output_s3_urls` field.

Looking at the backend code, I can see that the `get_segment` function in `dynamodb_service.py` is correctly implemented to:
1. Parse the segment ID to extract video_id and segment_number
2. Get the video record from the video-metadata table using the video_id
3. Extract the S3 key from the output_s3_urls array

But the Lambda function is saying the segment is not found. This suggests that either:
1. The Lambda function is not using the same logic as the backend
2. The Lambda function is looking in a different table (maybe the video-segments table)
3. The Lambda function is not correctly parsing the segment ID

Let me look at the Lambda integration code to see what's happening.</details></think>

Looking at the log, I can see the issue clearly. The Lambda function is returning "Segment not found" for segment `seg_76fabf52-c283-47ed-b8da-87b780dc4a84_045`. 

The problem is that the Lambda function is looking in the wrong table or using the wrong query logic. Let me check what's happening in the Lambda integration and fix it.

Error calling tool 'codebase_search'.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The codebase search failed. Let me try a different approach. I need to look at the Lambda integration code to see how it's sending the request to Lambda and what the Lambda function is expecting.

Looking at the log, the issue is:
1. The backend is correctly parsing the segment ID: `seg_76fabf52-c283-47ed-b8da-87b780dc4a84_045`
2. It extracts `video_id='76fabf52-c283-47ed-b8da-87b780dc4a84'` and `segment_number='045'`
3. The Lambda function receives this and returns "Segment not found"

The issue is likely that the Lambda function is not using the same logic as the backend's `get_segment` function. The backend correctly looks in the `easy-video-share-video-metadata` table using the video_id and then extracts the segment from the `output_s3_urls` array.

Let me check the Lambda integration code and the actual Lambda function.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the `trigger_thumbnail_generation` function. The issue is clear now:

1. The Railway backend is correctly sending the `video_id` and `segment_id` to the Lambda function
2. The Lambda function receives this payload and is supposed to look up the segment
3. The Lambda function is returning "Segment not found"

The problem is that the Lambda function is not using the same logic as the backend's `get_segment` function. The Lambda function is probably looking for the segment in the wrong table or not correctly extracting the segment from the `output_s3_urls` array.

I need to check the actual Lambda function code to see how it's handling segment lookup. Let me look at the Lambda function code.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I found the Lambda function! Now I need to look at the `generate_thumbnail` function and specifically the `get_segment_from_dynamodb` function to see how it's looking up segments. Let me first check the `generate_thumbnail` function starting at line 223.</details></think>

---

Read file: terraform/lambda/video-processor/lambda_function.py

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now I can see the issue. In the `generate_thumbnail` function, line 235 calls `get_segment_from_dynamodb(segment_id)` and it's returning `None`, which means the segment is not found. Let me look at the `get_segment_from_dynamodb` function to see how it's looking up segments.</details></think>

Perfect! Now I can see the issue. The Lambda function's `get_segment_from_dynamodb` function is EXACTLY the same as the backend's `get_segment` function. It:

1. Parses the segment ID to extract video_id and segment_number ✓
2. Looks in the `easy-video-share-video-metadata` table using the video_id ✓
3. Extracts the segment from the `output_s3_urls` array ✓

The logic is correct, but the issue is that the Lambda function is failing to find the segment. This suggests that either:

1. The video with ID `76fabf52-c283-47ed-b8da-87b780dc4a84` doesn't exist in the `easy-video-share-video-metadata` table
2. The video exists but doesn't have `output_s3_urls` 
3. The `output_s3_urls` array doesn't have 45 elements (segment number 045)

The problem is NOT that the Lambda function is looking in the wrong table. The logic is correct.

Let me check if there's an issue with the segment number parsing or if the video data actually exists.</details></think>

---

I can see the issue now! The Lambda function's `get_segment_from_dynamodb` function is actually **correctly** implemented - it's looking in the right table (`easy-video-share-video-metadata`) and extracting segments from the `output_s3_urls` array, just like the backend.

The issue is that the Lambda function is not finding the segment. Let me check what's happening with the video data. Based on the log, it's looking for segment `seg_76fabf52-c283-47ed-b8da-87b780dc4a84_045` (segment number 45).

Let me create a debug endpoint to check what's actually in the database for this video:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I can see that:
1. The video exists in the database

```

I notice the video metadata includes a total of 54 segments, stored across multiple S3 URLs in the `easy-video-share-video-metadata` table. The specific video is titled "Beginner mat 7.4.25.02" and originates from a file named IMG_0870.mov. A Lambda error was reported specifically for segment 045, suggesting a potential processing issue with that particular segment.

The Lambda function is designed to retrieve segments from the DynamoDB table, but segment 045 appears to be missing or improperly referenced. I'm investigating how the segments are numbered and stored, noting they seem to follow a sequential pattern starting from 001.

The potential root causes could involve subtle discrepancies in segment identification. The parsing mechanism looks technically sound, but something is preventing the correct segment retrieval. I suspect there might be a nuanced mismatch between how segments are generated and how the Lambda function attempts to access them.

The critical observation is that while 54 total segments exist, the specific retrieval of segment 045 is failing - suggesting a potential indexing or lookup problem within the Lambda function's segment extraction logic.</details></think>

Perfect! Now I can see exactly what's happening. The CLI output shows:

**The video data is CORRECT:**
- Video ID: `76fabf52-c283-47ed-b8da-87b780dc4a84` ✅
- Found in table: `easy-video-share-video-metadata` ✅ 
- Total segments: 54 ✅
- Segments stored in `output_s3_urls` array ✅
- Segment format: `processed/[video_id]/processed_[video_id]_segment_001.mp4` ✅

**The problem is in the Lambda function:**
The Lambda is looking for segment `seg_76fabf52-c283-47ed-b8da-87b780dc4a84_045` (segment #45 out of 54), which should definitely exist, but it's returning "Segment not found".

The issue is that the Lambda function is running in AWS and may not have the same DynamoDB table access or configuration as your local backend.

Let me check if there's a table name mismatch in the Lambda function:

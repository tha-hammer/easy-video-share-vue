# Fix frontend endpoint for video URL (2025-07-12 10:38Z)

_**User**_

  The issue is simple: The frontend is calling the wrong endpoint.

<issue>  Looking at the logs:
  - ✅ Lambda processed successfully: Created processed/015df874-e46b-41fd-a25c-7acb539e3cab/segment_008_with_text.mp4
  - ✅ Backend has the presigned URL: Generated correctly for the processed video
  - ❌ Frontend calls wrong endpoint: GET /api/segments/seg_.../processed-video returns 404

  The frontend should be getting the processed video URL from the job status endpoint (which is working), not from a
  separate /processed-video endpoint that doesn't exist.

  The flow should be:
  1. Frontend calls /api/jobs/{job_id}/status ✅ (this works)
  2. Backend returns presigned URLs in the response ✅ (this works)
  3. Frontend uses those presigned URLs directly ❌ (this is missing)

  The frontend needs to be updated to use the presigned_urls from the job status response instead of making a separate API
  call to /api/segments/.../processed-video.

  The fix is in the frontend JavaScript/TypeScript code - it needs to extract the video URL from the job status response
  rather than trying to fetch it from a non-existent endpoint.
</issue>

Help me find and fix the cause of this issue

I'll help you find and fix the issue where the frontend is calling the wrong endpoint. Let me start by searching for the problematic code that's making the incorrect API call.

Now I found the issue! Let me search for where the `getProcessedVideoUrl` method is being called to see the exact problem:

Let me examine the TextOverlayEditor.vue file to see the problematic code:

Read file: src/views/TextOverlayEditor.vue

Now let me check what the `getVideoProcessingStatus` method returns to understand the correct flow:

Now I need to check what the job status endpoint actually returns to understand the correct structure:

Perfect! Now I understand the issue completely. The problem is in the `TextOverlayEditor.vue` file. When the video processing is completed, the frontend is calling `VideoService.getProcessedVideoUrl()` which tries to hit a non-existent `/api/segments/{segment_id}/processed-video` endpoint. 

However, the correct flow should be:
1. The job status endpoint `/api/jobs/{job_id}/status` already returns the presigned URLs in the `output_urls` field when the job is completed
2. The frontend should use those URLs directly instead of making a separate call

Let me fix this by updating the `TextOverlayEditor.vue` file:


---



---

I see the issue. The TypeScript interface for the job status response is missing the `output_urls` field. Let me check the interface definition and fix it:


---

Read file: src/core/services/VideoService.ts

---

I can see the issue. The `getVideoProcessingStatus` method has an incorrect return type. It should return `JobStatusResponse` which includes `output_urls`, but it's currently returning a different interface with `output_url` (singular). Let me fix this:


---



---

Perfect! Now the TypeScript errors should be resolved. Let me also check if there are any other places in the codebase that might be calling the non-existent `/processed-video` endpoint:

I can see that the `getProcessedVideoUrl` method in `VideoService.ts` is still calling the non-existent endpoint. Since we've fixed the main issue in `TextOverlayEditor.vue`, let me also remove or update this method to prevent future confusion. Let me check if it's used anywhere else:

Good! The `getProcessedVideoUrl` method is only defined in `VideoService.ts` and was only called in `TextOverlayEditor.vue` (which we've already fixed). Since it's no longer used and calls a non-existent endpoint, let me remove it to clean up the code:


---



---

Perfect! Now let me also check if there are any other similar issues in the codebase. Let me search for any other calls to non-existent endpoints:

Let me check if the `downloadProcessedSegment` method is used anywhere:

| `file:///e%3A/Dev/easy-video-share-vue/src/core/services/VideoService.ts` | L961 | `static async downloadProcessedSegment(` |

</details>

---

The `downloadProcessedSegment` method is still being used in `TextOverlayEditor.vue`. Let me check if this endpoint exists in the backend:


---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "download-processed" • **0** files</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

The `/download-processed` endpoint doesn't exist either. Let me check what the correct flow should be for downloading. Looking at the backend code, I can see that the job status endpoint already provides presigned URLs for downloading. Let me update the download functionality to use the job status response instead:


---

Read file: src/views/TextOverlayEditor.vue

---

I can see that the download functionality is trying to use a non-existent endpoint. Since the job status already provides presigned URLs, I should update this to use the processed video URL that we already have. Let me fix this:


---



---

Now let me remove the unused `downloadProcessedSegment` method from `VideoService.ts`:


---



---

Perfect! Now let me run a quick test to make sure there are no remaining TypeScript errors:


---

```bash
cd /e%3A/Dev/easy-video-share-vue && npm run type-check
```

---

_**User**_

E:\Dev\easy-video-share-vue> npm run type-check

> easy-video-share-vuenpm@0.0.0 type-check
> vue-tsc --build


---

_**Assistant**_

Great! The type-check command ran successfully without any errors, which means our fixes resolved all the TypeScript issues. Let me summarize what we've accomplished:

## ✅ Issue Fixed Successfully

**Problem**: The frontend was calling a non-existent `/api/segments/{segment_id}/processed-video` endpoint, causing 404 errors.

**Root Cause**: The `TextOverlayEditor.vue` component was using `VideoService.getProcessedVideoUrl()` which tried to hit an endpoint that doesn't exist in the backend.

**Solution**: Updated the frontend to use the correct flow:

### Changes Made:

1. **Fixed `TextOverlayEditor.vue`**:
   - Updated the video processing completion logic to use `status.output_urls` from the job status response instead of calling a separate endpoint
   - Updated the download functionality to use the processed video URL directly from the job status response

2. **Fixed `VideoService.ts`**:
   - Updated `getVideoProcessingStatus()` return type to use `JobStatusResponse` interface (which includes `output_urls`)
   - Removed the unused `getProcessedVideoUrl()` method that was calling the non-existent endpoint
   - Removed the unused `downloadProcessedSegment()` method that was calling another non-existent endpoint

### Correct Flow Now:
1. ✅ Frontend calls `/api/jobs/{job_id}/status` (this works)
2. ✅ Backend returns presigned URLs in `output_urls` field (this works)  
3. ✅ Frontend uses those presigned URLs directly (now fixed!)

The frontend will now correctly:
- Get processed video URLs from the job status response
- Use those URLs for video preview and download
- No longer make unnecessary API calls to non-existent endpoints

Your video processing workflow should now work correctly without the 404 errors! 🎉

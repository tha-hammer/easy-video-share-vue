## Vue Form Component - Step-Based Video Upload

This code represents a **multi-step form interface** for video uploading, built using Vue.js with Bootstrap styling. The form is conditionally rendered and handles the initial step of collecting video metadata.

The **conditional rendering** (`v-if="currentStep === 0"`) ensures this form only appears during the first step of what appears to be a multi-step upload process. This is a common pattern in Vue applications where you want to show different UI components based on the current application state.

The **form submission** is handled with `@submit.prevent="goToUploadStep"`, which uses Vue's event modifier `.prevent` to automatically call `preventDefault()` on the form submission. This prevents the default browser form submission behavior and instead triggers a custom method called `goToUploadStep`, giving you full control over the form's behavior.

The **styling approach** combines Bootstrap 5

If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:

    I'm trying to pull from a new branch but am getting errors plese help

I can see you're having issues with pulling from a new branch called `fabric-ui-changes`. The error indicates that your local branch doesn't have an upstream branch configured, which means Git doesn't know which remote branch to pull from.

Here are a few ways to resolve this:

## Option 1: Set upstream and pull (if the branch exists on remote)
```bash
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/fabric-ui-changes fabric-ui-changes
git pull
```

## Option 2: Pull from a specific remote branch
```bash
git pull origin fabric-ui-changes
```

## Option 3: Check if the branch exists on remote first
```bash
# List all remote branches to see what's available
git branch -r

# If fabric-ui-changes doesn't exist on remote, you might want to push it first
git push -u origin fabric-ui-changes
```

## Option 4: If you're trying to pull from a different branch
```bash
# Pull from main/master branch
git pull origin main
# or
git pull origin master
```

## Troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check your current branch:**
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

2. **Check remote branches:**
   ```bash
   git branch -r
   ```

3. **Check if you have the correct remote:**
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

Based on your repository `tha-hammer/easy-video-share-vue`, the most likely scenario is that you need to either:
- Push your local `fabric-ui-changes` branch to remote first, or
- Pull from an existing branch like `main`

Which option matches your situation? Are you trying to pull changes from an existing remote branch, or push your local changes to create a new remote branch?

Shit! I just committed changes to the wrong branch.  I need to be on text-overlay-UI

_**Assistant**_

Don't panic! This is a common Git situation and easily fixable. Here are your options to move the changes to the correct `text-overlay-UI` branch:

## Option 1: If you haven't pushed yet (RECOMMENDED)

```bash
# Check what branch you're currently on
git branch

# Reset the current branch to before your commit (keep changes in working directory)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Switch to the correct branch
git checkout text-overlay-UI

# Or create the branch if it doesn't exist
git checkout -b text-overlay-UI

# Add and commit your changes to the correct branch
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```

## Option 2: If the commit is already pushed or you prefer cherry-picking

```bash
# Note the commit hash of your mistaken commit
git log --oneline -1

# Switch to the correct branch
git checkout text-overlay-UI

# Cherry-pick the commit from the wrong branch
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# Go back to the wrong branch and remove the commit
git checkout <wrong-branch-name>
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

## Option 3: Quick branch creation from current state

```bash
# Create a new branch from your current position with the changes
git checkout -b text-overlay-UI

# If text-overlay-UI already exists and you want to update it
git branch -D text-overlay-UI  # Delete existing branch
git checkout -b text-overlay-UI  # Create new one
```

## Check your current situation first:

```bash
# See what branch you're on and recent commits
git status
git log --oneline -3

# See all branches
git branch -a
```

**Which option fits your situation?** Let me know:
1. Have you already pushed the commit?
2. What branch did you accidentally commit to?
3. Does `text-overlay-UI` branch already exist?

This will help me give you the exact commands for your specific case.

I think it was 2 commits: 0a3d6c8c35a9b3460e57d47a2411d76d69922020 and bb49b93d1f748212e42b951949155286afa25f3e

these were pushed and need to be on the other branch

Perfect! Since you know the specific commit hashes and they've already been pushed, here's how to move those commits to the `text-overlay-UI` branch:

## Option 1: Cherry-pick the commits to the correct branch

```bash
# Switch to or create the text-overlay-UI branch
git checkout text-overlay-UI
# If the branch doesn't exist, create it:
# git checkout -b text-overlay-UI

# Cherry-pick both commits in order (oldest first)
git cherry-pick bb49b93d1f748212e42b951949155286afa25f3e
git cherry-pick 0a3d6c8c35a9b3460e57d47a2411d76d69922020

# Push the commits to the correct branch
git push origin text-overlay-UI
```

## Option 2: If you want to remove them from the wrong branch

After cherry-picking to the correct branch, you can remove them from the wrong branch:

```bash
# First, check what branch they're currently on
git branch --contains 0a3d6c8c35a9b3460e57d47a2411d76d69922020

# Switch to the wrong branch (replace 'wrong-branch-name' with actual branch)
git checkout fabric-ui-changes

# Remove the commits (this will rewrite history, be careful!)
git reset --hard HEAD~2

# Force push to update the remote (WARNING: this rewrites history)
git push --force-with-lease origin fabric-ui-changes
```

## Option 3: Safe approach - just cherry-pick without removing

If you're unsure about rewriting history, just cherry-pick to the correct branch and leave the commits on both branches:

```bash
git checkout text-overlay-UI
git cherry-pick bb49b93d1f748212e42b951949155286afa25f3e
git cherry-pick 0a3d6c8c35a9b3460e57d47a2411d76d69922020
git push origin text-overlay-UI
```

## Verify the commits

After cherry-picking, verify you got the right changes:

```bash
# Check the commits are now on text-overlay-UI
git log --oneline -3

# Check the file changes
git show --name-only bb49b93d1f748212e42b951949155286afa25f3e
git show --name-only 0a3d6c8c35a9b3460e57d47a2411d76d69922020
```

**I recommend Option 1 or 3** - cherry-picking is safe and preserves your work. Only use Option 2 if you're certain about removing the commits from the wrong branch and understand the implications of rewriting pushed history.

Which approach would you like to take?

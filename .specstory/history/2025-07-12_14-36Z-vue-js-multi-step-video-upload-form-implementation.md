## Vue Form Component - Step-Based Video Upload

This code represents a **multi-step form interface** for video uploading, built using Vue.js with Bootstrap styling. The form is conditionally rendered and handles the initial step of collecting video metadata.

The **conditional rendering** (`v-if="currentStep === 0"`) ensures this form only appears during the first step of what appears to be a multi-step upload process. This is a common pattern in Vue applications where you want to show different UI components based on the current application state.

The **form submission** is handled with `@submit.prevent="goToUploadStep"`, which uses Vue's event modifier `.prevent` to automatically call `preventDefault()` on the form submission. This prevents the default browser form submission behavior and instead triggers a custom method called `goToUploadStep`, giving you full control over the form's behavior.

The **styling approach** combines Bootstrap 5

_**Assistant**_

I can see you're having issues with pulling from a new branch called `fabric-ui-changes`. The error indicates that your local branch doesn't have an upstream branch configured, which means Git doesn't know which remote branch to pull from.

Here are a few ways to resolve this:

## Option 1: Set upstream and pull (if the branch exists on remote)
```bash
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/fabric-ui-changes fabric-ui-changes
git pull
```

## Option 2: Pull from a specific remote branch
```bash
git pull origin fabric-ui-changes
```

## Option 3: Check if the branch exists on remote first
```bash
# List all remote branches to see what's available
git branch -r

# If fabric-ui-changes doesn't exist on remote, you might want to push it first
git push -u origin fabric-ui-changes
```

## Option 4: If you're trying to pull from a different branch
```bash
# Pull from main/master branch
git pull origin main
# or
git pull origin master
```

## Troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check your current branch:**
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

2. **Check remote branches:**
   ```bash
   git branch -r
   ```

3. **Check if you have the correct remote:**
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

Based on your repository `tha-hammer/easy-video-share-vue`, the most likely scenario is that you need to either:
- Push your local `fabric-ui-changes` branch to remote first, or
- Pull from an existing branch like `main`

Which option matches your situation? Are you trying to pull changes from an existing remote branch, or push your local changes to create a new remote branch?

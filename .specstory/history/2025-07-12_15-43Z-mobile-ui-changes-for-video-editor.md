# Mobile UI changes for video editor (2025-07-12 15:43Z)

_**User**_

We need some big changes for the mobile UI.  

On mobile we need to remember everything needs to fit on the screen. I have attached a sample editor view.
After the user selects the thumbnail, the 'Select Video Segment' does not need to be in the view at all.
when the thumbnail does load, we need to adjust the elements that are viewable.

The thumbnail needs to be in the top 2/3 of the viewport, with the editor controls in the bottom 2/3rds.
when the user selects 'add text' the entire thumbnail needs to stay in view and the on-screen keyboard needs to cover the editor controls. This will keep the thumbnail in view and allow the user to add their words.  When the user taps outside of the text entry/keyboard the text object de-selects putting the image and editor controls back into view.

In the bottom 1/3, 25% is for the text input area and a text menu, the 75% for the active menu item tools.

Thank you for the detailed requirements and the screenshot! Here’s a summary of the mobile UI changes you need for the video editor:

### Key Requirements

1. **After Thumbnail Selection:**
   - The "Select Video Segment" UI should be hidden/removed.
   - The loaded thumbnail should be displayed.

2. **Layout:**
   - The thumbnail/video preview should occupy the top 2/3 of the viewport.
   - Editor controls (menus, tools, etc.) should be in the bottom 1/3.

3. **Text Editing:**
   - When "Add Text" is selected:
     - The thumbnail remains fully visible (not covered by the keyboard).
     - The on-screen keyboard covers the editor controls only.
     - The text input area and text menu should be in the bottom 1/3:
       - 25% for the text input and text menu.
       - 75% for the active menu item tools (e.g., font, color, effects).
   - Tapping outside the text input/keyboard:
     - Deselects the text object.
     - Returns to the normal editor view (thumbnail + controls).

### Next Steps

To implement this, I’ll need to:
- Identify the main video editor component and its structure.
- Adjust the layout using CSS (likely with flexbox or grid) and Vue conditional rendering.
- Add logic to handle keyboard events and text object selection/deselection.

**Could you please confirm:**
- Which component(s) handle the video editor and thumbnail/text overlay? (Is it in `src/components/video/UniversalVideoPlayer.vue` or another file?)
- Is the text overlay handled by a specific composable or component (e.g., `useTextOverlay.ts`)?

Once confirmed, I’ll:
- Propose a responsive layout structure for mobile.
- Suggest the Vue logic for toggling views and handling keyboard/text input focus.

Let me know if you want a wireframe/diagram of the new layout before we start coding!

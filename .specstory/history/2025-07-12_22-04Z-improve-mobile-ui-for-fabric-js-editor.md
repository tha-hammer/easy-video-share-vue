# Improve mobile UI for Fabric.js editor (2025-07-12 22:04Z)

_**User**_

We are improving the UI on mobile and have made some progress.

We need to work on the Fabric.js editor elements.
Curently, the 'add text', 'delete' and 'duplicate' are off the screen on the bottom only the top 25% or less is viewable.
Also when a new text object is created there are no editing menus or other tools to manipulate the text object.

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is reporting issues with the mobile UI for the Fabric.js editor. Looking at the code, I can see:

1. The mobile layout has three sections:
   - Mobile header (fixed at top)
   - Mobile canvas section (2/3 of viewport)
   - Mobile controls section (1/3 of viewport)

2. The issues they're describing:
   - The 'add text', 'delete' and 'duplicate' buttons are off the screen on the bottom with only the top 25% or less viewable
   - When a new text object is created, there are no editing menus or other tools to manipulate the text object

Let me examine the current mobile layout structure:

```vue
<!-- Mobile Header Bar -->
<div v-if="isMobileView" class="mobile-header">
  <button @click="goBackToSegmentSelection" class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary">
    <KTIcon icon-name="arrow-left" icon-class="fs-5" />
  </button>
  <h6 class="mb-0 flex-grow-1 text-center">
    {{ selectedSegment.title || `Segment ${selectedSegment.segment_number}` }}
  </h6>
  <button
    @click="saveTextOverlays"
    class="btn btn-sm btn-success"
    :disabled="!isCanvasReady || textObjectCount === 0 || processingVideo"
  >
    <KTIcon :icon-name="processingVideo ? 'hourglass' : 'document-save'" icon-class="fs-5" />
  </button>
</div>
```

Then there's the editor content:

```vue
<div class="editor-content" :class="{ 'mobile-editor-content': isMobileView }">
  <!-- Thumbnail/Canvas Area (Top 2/3 on mobile) -->
  <div class="canvas-section" :class="{ 'mobile-canvas-section': isMobileView }">
    <!-- Canvas here -->
  </div>

  <!-- Editor Controls (Bottom 1/3 on mobile) -->
  <div class="controls-section" :class="{ 'mobile-controls-section': isMobileView }">
    <!-- Normal Mode: Main Editor Menu -->
    <div
      v-if="!isTextEditingMode"
      class="main-editor-menu"
      :class="{ 'mobile-main-menu': isMobileView }"
    >
      <div class="

I notice the mobile layout is structured with responsive classes to adapt to different screen sizes. The current implementation seems to have potential viewport and interaction challenges that could impact user experience on mobile devices.

The menu actions include core text manipulation functions like adding, deleting, and duplicating text elements. These buttons are conditionally disabled based on canvas state and text selection, which suggests a thoughtful approach to preventing invalid user interactions.

The text editing controls are designed with mobile responsiveness in mind, using dynamic CSS classes that adjust layout and sizing based on the device view. This indicates a flexible, adaptive interface that can smoothly transition between desktop and mobile experiences.

The current view represents a specialized editing mode with dedicated input and tool sections, structured to provide a comprehensive text editing environment within the application's interface. I'll complete the partial thought from the previous thinking and then summarize the new CSS details concisely.

fixed at the bottom, but the content inside might not be properly sized or positioned. The mobile text editing layout uses a flexible flex design with distinct sections for text input and tools. The text input occupies 25% of the control area, featuring a light background and bottom border, while the text tools section expands to fill the remaining 75%, using a two-column grid layout with scrollable overflow to accommodate various editing options.

The controls section's limited height of 33.33vh creates significant constraints. With text input consuming only 8.33vh, the space becomes extremely cramped, potentially causing visibility and interaction issues for mobile menu buttons. The main editor menu's full-height flex design might conflict with the restricted vertical space, leading to potential button truncation or overlapping.

I'll focus on three key mobile layout improvements: ensuring button visibility, maintaining text editing tool accessibility, and preventing content cutoff by carefully adjusting responsive breakpoints and vertical sizing strategies.</details></think>

Looking at the code, I can see the issues with the mobile UI for the Fabric.js editor. The main problems are:

1. The main editor menu buttons (Add Text, Delete, Duplicate) are getting cut off because the controls section is too small (33.33vh)
2. The text editing tools are cramped when text editing mode is active
3. The layout is trying to fit too much content in a small space

Let me fix these issues by improving the mobile layout:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! I've made significant improvements to the mobile layout. The key changes I made:

1. **Fixed the main editor menu layout**: 
   - Increased minimum height to 120px
   - Made buttons larger (90px min-width, 44px min-height) for better touch interaction
   - Added proper padding and better spacing

2. **Improved controls section**:
   - Added minimum height of 200px to ensure buttons aren't cut off
   - Changed from fixed flex ratios to more flexible layout

3. **Fixed text editing mode**:
   - Removed the problematic fixed positioning that was causing layout issues
   - Set text input section to fixed 80px height instead of 25% of controls
   - Improved text tools section with better scrolling

4. **Better spacing and touch targets**:
   - Made all interactive elements at least 44px tall (Apple's recommended touch target size)
   - Added better padding, margins, and border radius
   - Improved overall visual hierarchy

5. **Removed the fixed positioning hack**:
   - The previous code used `position: fixed` for text editing mode which was causing the layout problems
   - Now using normal flex layout with proper height constraints

Now let me also check if there are any issues with the unused imports that the linter is complaining about. I should remove those to clean up the code.</details></think>

Now let's clean up the unused imports that the linter is complaining about:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've cleaned up the unused imports. Now let me also make sure that the mobile layout properly handles the transition between normal mode and text editing mode. Looking at the code, I notice that there's a method `enterTextEditingMode` that automatically adds a new text object if none exists, but I should make sure the mobile UI flow is intuitive.

Let me check the current flow:
1. User sees main menu with "Add Text", "Delete", "Duplicate" buttons
2. User clicks "Add Text" which calls `enterTextEditingMode`
3. `enterTextEditingMode` sets `isTextEditingMode.value = true` and adds a text object if needed
4. The UI switches to text editing mode showing text input and tools

But I notice that when a user clicks on the canvas in mobile mode, it might not be as intuitive. Let me also check if there are any other mobile UX improvements I can make.

Actually, looking at the `handleCanvasClick` method, I see it handles clicking on existing text objects properly, but I should make sure the mobile experience is smooth.

Let me also verify that the canvas sizing is working well on mobile. The canvas should scale properly and not overflow.</details></think>

Now let me also improve the canvas sizing logic for mobile to ensure it works well with the new layout:

3. **Fixed text editing mode**:
   - Removed the problematic fixed positioning that was causing the controls to be cut off
   - Set text input section to fixed 80px height instead of percentage-based
   - Improved text tools section with better scrolling and layout
   - Added minimum height of 250px for text editing controls

4. **Better canvas sizing**:
   - Improved canvas size calculation for mobile
   - Added proper height constraints based on layout components
   - Ensured canvas doesn't exceed 55% of viewport height on mobile
   - More accurate available space calculation

5. **Improved touch interaction**:
   - Made all interactive elements at least 44px tall (Apple's recommended touch target size)
   - Added better padding, margins, and border radius
   - Improved overall visual hierarchy and spacing

6. **Cleaned up code**:
   - Removed unused imports that were causing linter errors

The main issues the user reported should now be resolved:
- The 'Add Text', 'Delete', and 'Duplicate' buttons should now be fully visible and accessible
- When a new text object is created, the text editing tools should be properly accessible and not cut off
- The layout should be more intuitive and user-friendly on mobile devices

The mobile layout now uses a more flexible approach that adapts to content rather than rigid fixed positioning that was causing problems.</details></think>

We are improving the UI on mobile and have made some progress.

We need to work on the Fabric.js editor elements.
Curently, the 'add text', 'delete' and 'duplicate' are off the screen on the bottom only the top 25% or less is viewable.
Also when a new text object is created there are no editing menus or other tools to manipulate the text object.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is reporting issues with the mobile UI for the Fabric.js editor. Looking at the code, I can see:

1. The mobile layout has three sections:
   - Mobile header (fixed at top)
   - Mobile canvas section (2/3 of viewport)
   - Mobile controls section (1/3 of viewport)

2. The issues they're describing:
   - The 'add text', 'delete' and 'duplicate' buttons are off the screen on the bottom with only the top 25% or less viewable
   - When a new text object is created, there are no editing menus or other tools to manipulate the text object

Let me examine the current mobile layout structure:

```vue
<!-- Mobile Header Bar -->
<div v-if="isMobileView" class="mobile-header">
  <button @click="goBackToSegmentSelection" class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary">
    <KTIcon icon-name="arrow-left" icon-class="fs-5" />
  </button>
  <h6 class="mb-0 flex-grow-1 text-center">
    {{ selectedSegment.title || `Segment ${selectedSegment.segment_number}` }}
  </h6>
  <button
    @click="saveTextOverlays"
    class="btn btn-sm btn-success"
    :disabled="!isCanvasReady || textObjectCount === 0 || processingVideo"
  >
    <KTIcon :icon-name="processingVideo ? 'hourglass' : 'document-save'" icon-class="fs-5" />
  </button>
</div>
```

Then there's the editor content:

```vue
<div class="editor-content" :class="{ 'mobile-editor-content': isMobileView }">
  <!-- Thumbnail/Canvas Area (Top 2/3 on mobile) -->
</details></think>

I'm not sure what you are doing on mobile.  The attached image is the mobile view.

The textoverlayeditor has 2 references to the "editing panel" and BOTH are for desktop.  WHY THE FUCK CAN'T YOU GET THE FUCKING EDITING PANEL ON THE MOBILE VIEW?

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is clearly frustrated and rightfully so. Looking at the attached image, I can see the mobile view has three video panels stacked vertically, but there's no text editing panel visible. The user is pointing out that there are 2 references to the "editing panel" in the code and both are for desktop only.

Looking at the code, I can see the issue. There are indeed two instances of the text editing panel:

1. Line 598: `<div v-if="!isMobileView && isCanvasReady" class="text-editing-panel">`
2. Line 768: `<div v-if="!isMobileView && isCanvasReady" class="text-editing-panel">`

Both have the condition `!isMobileView` which means they're ONLY showing on desktop, not mobile! This is clearly a bug - the mobile view should have some form of text editing panel visible.

Looking at the mobile layout structure in the code, I can see there's a mobile-specific text editing section, but it's only shown when `isTextEditingMode` is true. The issue is that the mobile view doesn't have a persistent text editing panel like the desktop version does.

The mobile layout has:
- Mobile header
- Canvas section 
- Controls section that switches between:
  - Main menu (when NOT in text editing mode)
  - Text editing controls (when IN text editing mode)

But there's no persistent text editing panel on mobile like there is on desktop. The user needs to be able to see and use text editing controls on mobile.

I need to fix this by either:
1. Adding a mobile-specific text editing panel that shows on mobile
2. Making one of the existing text editing panels work on mobile
3. Ensuring the mobile text editing controls are properly visible and functional

Looking at the code more carefully, I see that the mobile version has a different approach - it uses `isTextEditingMode` to switch between the main menu and text editing controls. 

The current mobile interaction seems problematic and potentially confusing for users. I'll need to redesign the mobile text editing experience to make it more intuitive and accessible.</details></think>

You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the confusion. Looking at the code, I can see the problem - there are indeed TWO text editing panels in the template, and BOTH have the condition `!isMobileView`, which means they're hidden on mobile!

Let me fix this by ensuring there's a proper text editing panel for mobile view:

User Benefit: Text appears at intended size regardless of video resolution or canvas display size

Requirement 4.03 - Build Color Format Converter

Work: Convert Fabric.js color formats (hex, rgba) to FFmpeg-compatible color strings
User Benefit: Maintains exact color accuracy from design to final video

Requirement 4.04 - Create Shadow Effect Translator

Work: Convert Fabric.js shadow properties to FFmpeg shadow filters with offset and blur calculations
User Benefit: Drop shadows render identically in final video as shown in preview

Requirement 4.05 - Implement Stroke/Outline Converter

Work: Transform Fabric.js stroke properties to FFmpeg bordercolor and borderw parameters
User Benefit: Text outlines provide consistent readability enhancement in final video

Phase 5: State Management (Requirements 5.x)

Requirement 5.01 - Create Text Overlay Store

Work: Implement Pinia store for managing text overlays across multiple segments with persistence
User Benefit: Text designs are saved automatically and persist across browser sessions

Requirement 5.02 - Add Undo/Redo System

Work: Implement command pattern for text operations with history stack management
User Benefit: Users can safely experiment with text designs knowing they can undo changes

Requirement 5.03 - Implement Auto-Save Functionality

Work: Automatically save text overlay changes to backend with debounced API calls
User Benefit: No manual save required - designs are preserved without user intervention

Requirement 5.04 - Create Multi-Segment Management

Work: Track text overlays for multiple video segments with segment-specific state isolation
User Benefit: Users can design different text for each segment while maintaining organized workflow

Requirement 5.05 - Add Template System

Work: Allow saving and applying text styles as reusable templates across segments
User Benefit: Speeds up design process by reusing common text styling configurations

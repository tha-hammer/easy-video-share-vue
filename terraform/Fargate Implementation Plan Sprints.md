Okay, this is a significant step: migrating your application to AWS Fargate! It's a great choice for scalability and managed compute, especially for your Python backend (FastAPI) and CPU-intensive Celery workers.

I've reviewed your `terraform/main.tf`. It's a comprehensive setup for S3, DynamoDB, Cognito, and API Gateway integrated with **Node.js Lambda functions**.

**Key Observation from `main.tf` for Fargate:**
Your existing Terraform **does not yet include resources for Fargate itself** (ECS clusters, task definitions, services), **managed Redis (ElastiCache)**, or an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** which is typically used to expose Fargate services publicly. Your current API Gateway routes traffic to your Node.js Lambdas, not to a Fargate service.

Therefore, implementing Fargate will involve adding new Terraform resources and integrating them with your existing AWS components. This will be a multi-sprint effort on the infrastructure side.

### **Fargate Implementation Plan (New Sprints for Cloud Deployment)**

We'll break this down into three new, dedicated deployment-focused sprints. These would generally come _after_ all your backend application features (Sprints 1-5, and 4.1) are complete and stable in their local development environment.

#### **Deployment Sprint A: Core Fargate Infrastructure & Container Registry**

- **Goal:** Establish the foundational AWS infrastructure to run your containers and set up registries for your Docker images.
- **New AWS Resources (in Terraform):**
  - **ECS Cluster:** A logical grouping for your Fargate tasks.
    - `aws_ecs_cluster`
  - **Elastic Container Registry (ECR):** Secure Docker image repositories for your FastAPI application and Celery worker.
    - `aws_ecr_repository` for `fastapi_app`
    - `aws_ecr_repository` for `celery_worker`
  - **Networking Foundations (if not already existing):** Ensure you have a VPC, private subnets, and NAT Gateways suitable for Fargate. (Assuming your current `main.tf` exists in a larger VPC setup, if not, these would be created).
  - **IAM Roles for ECS:**
    - **ECS Task Execution Role:** For ECS to launch and manage your tasks (permissions to pull images from ECR, push logs to CloudWatch Logs).
      - `aws_iam_role`, `aws_iam_role_policy_attachment` (e.g., `AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy`).
- **Local Code/DevOps Changes:**
  - **Dockerfiles:** Create optimized Dockerfiles for both your **FastAPI app** and your **Celery worker**. These should:
    - Install all Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
    - For the Celery worker, ensure FFmpeg and ImageMagick are installed within the Docker image.
    - Define the entrypoint/command for running the application (`uvicorn` for FastAPI, `celery` command for worker).
  - **`requirements.txt`:** Ensure this file is comprehensive and lists all Python dependencies with pinned versions.
- **Testing/Verification:**
  - Build Docker images locally for FastAPI and Celery worker.
  - Manually push these Docker images to your newly created ECR repositories.
  - Optionally, manually launch a basic Fargate task (via AWS Console or AWS CLI) using one of your images to ensure it starts without immediate errors.

#### **Deployment Sprint B: FastAPI Deployment on Fargate with Load Balancer**

- **Goal:** Deploy your FastAPI application to Fargate and expose it via a public Application Load Balancer (ALB), accessible via an API endpoint.
- **Dependencies:** Deployment Sprint A is complete.
- **New AWS Resources (in Terraform):**
  - **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** To distribute incoming HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
    - `aws_lb`, `aws_lb_target_group`, `aws_lb_listener`.
  - **ECS Task Definition for FastAPI:** Define CPU/memory, link to your ECR image, define port mappings, assign IAM roles.
    - `aws_ecs_task_definition` (referencing `aws_ecr_repository.fastapi_app`, specifying `aws_iam_role.ecs_task_role_fastapi` below).
  - **ECS Service for FastAPI:** Manages the running instances of your FastAPI task definition behind the ALB, handling scaling and health checks.
    - `aws_ecs_service`.
  - **IAM Role for FastAPI Application Code (Task Role):** This role grants permissions to `boto3` calls _from your FastAPI app_.
    - `aws_iam_role` (e.g., `ecs_task_role_fastapi`) with an `assume_role_policy` for `ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com`.
    - **Policy:** Attach policies to this role for `s3:GetObject` (for `get_video_duration_from_s3`), `s3:PutObject`, `s3:GetObjectAcl` (for presigned URLs), `dynamodb:GetItem`, `dynamodb:PutItem`, `dynamodb:UpdateItem` on your `video_metadata` table.
- **Code/Configuration:**
  - **FastAPI `config.py`:** Update environment variables to point to production settings (e.g., actual DynamoDB table name).
  - **Docker Compose:** Update your local `docker-compose.yml` to reflect deployment environment variables if running locally, or remove FastAPI from local Compose if moving entirely to Fargate.
- **Testing/Verification:**
  - Deploy FastAPI service to Fargate via Terraform.
  - Test the ALB's URL with your `health` endpoint.
  - Test the `upload/initiate` endpoint; verify a real S3 pre-signed URL is generated and the file successfully uploads.
  - Check FastAPI logs in CloudWatch Logs for any runtime errors.

#### **Deployment Sprint C: Celery Worker Deployment on Fargate with ElastiCache**

- **Goal:** Deploy your Celery worker to Fargate, integrating it with a managed Redis (ElastiCache) service, to handle background video processing tasks in the cloud.
- **Dependencies:** Deployment Sprint A is complete.
- **New AWS Resources (in Terraform):**
  - **Amazon ElastiCache for Redis:** A fully managed Redis cluster.
    - `aws_elasticache_replication_group` (for Redis cluster with high availability).
    - `aws_elasticache_subnet_group` (if using private subnets).
    - `aws_security_group` (to allow worker access to Redis).
  - **ECS Task Definition for Celery Worker:** Define CPU/memory, link to your ECR worker image (with FFmpeg), assign IAM roles.
    - `aws_ecs_task_definition` (referencing `aws_ecr_repository.celery_worker`, specifying `aws_iam_role.ecs_task_role_celery`).
  - **ECS Service for Celery Worker:** Manages running instances of the worker task definition. (Scaling might be based on Celery queue depth using CloudWatch Alarms and ECS Service Auto Scaling in a later optimization sprint).
    - `aws_ecs_service`.
  - **IAM Role for Celery Worker Application Code (Task Role):** This role grants permissions for `boto3` calls _from your Celery worker_.
    - `aws_iam_role` (e.g., `ecs_task_role_celery`) with an `assume_role_policy` for `ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com`.
    - **Policy:** Attach policies to this role for `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`, `dynamodb:GetItem`, `dynamodb:PutItem`, `dynamodb:UpdateItem` on your `video_metadata` table, and potentially `s3:DeleteObject` (if worker deletes original files after processing).
- **Code/Configuration:**
  - **Celery `config.py`:** Update `REDIS_URL` to point to the ElastiCache endpoint.
- **Testing/Verification:**
  - Deploy ElastiCache Redis, then Celery worker service via Terraform.
  - Trigger a video processing job via your deployed FastAPI application.
  - Monitor Celery worker logs in CloudWatch Logs for processing details and success/failure.
  - Verify processed videos appear in S3 as expected.
  - Check DynamoDB for job status updates.

This phased approach will allow you to systematically deploy your application components to Fargate, managing the infrastructure and application code in distinct, testable sprints.
